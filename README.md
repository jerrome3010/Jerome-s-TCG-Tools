About Jeromeâ€™s TCG Tool


I personally developed this suite of tools to streamline and automate various manual tasks frequently encountered in the TCG industry. The TCG Tool suite consists of three custom designed tools that enhance efficiency by simplifying these manual based tasks, ultimately saving valuable time and effort and also ensuring consistency in various aspects.

The Capitalize Tool was created to allow for the user to input the desired text and receive an output with the text capitalized. I mainly created this tool when making listings on ebay as well as  facebook marketplace as there was often latency when typing out the listing and this tool allowed for me to simply copy and paste the desired text making my listing experience more efficient and user friendly. 


The Buyee Purchase Tool was developed to ease the process when buying items off the buyee marketplace which is a third party japanese company that allows for users all over the world to purchase items from japan easily and cost effectively. The main problem that I encountered when purchasing various items from buyee usually Japanese Pokemon TCG, was that it was often difficult to manually calculate the final purchase price due to various fees including: platform fees, GST and final prices including the usage of discount coupons which I commonly used. I also incorporated a selling feature that also calculated profit and profit margins on multiple platforms including ebay and facebook. I have now added support for purchasing multiple items and incorporating a constant shipping rate to increase accuracy on total final price as well as the corresponding profit margins. The Buyee Purchase Tool is designed to enhance the user experience when utilizing the buyee platform as well as providing calculations if the user is interested in reselling the purchased items.

The Ebay Listing Format Tool was developed to simplify and enhance the process when creating as well as ensuring consistency when creating an ebay listing. I often found the ebay platform to have high latency when manually typing the listing title and description. This tool enables automation when creating the title and description for an ebay

The Ebay Listing Format Tool was developed to simplify and enhance the process of creating eBay listings, ensuring consistency across all entries. I often found the eBay platform to have high latency when manually typing the listing title and description. This tool utilizes automation within the creation of the title and description for an eBay listing, significantly reducing time and effort while maintaining consistency across all listings.

In the future, I intend to expand and enhance this suite of tools, with a particular focus on incorporating APIs. This will enable improved functionality and introduction features that are not currently possible, further streamlining and optimizing the user experience. For any suggestions or questions feel free to dm me through one of my socials.
